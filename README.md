## Probably the easiest method to integrate Vue with Meteor!

Clone the repository and start building awesome apps with Vue on front - of course with all the power of Meteor at the backend! The entire process should take less than three minutes. Specially for **you** I created the structure of an app, so that you can quickly and pleasantly start your next project. 

In `imports/ui/store.js` file you can find all logic behind VueX. Remember, it is very simple, just for case of boilerplate, so feel free to jump in and change it! 

In `imports/ui/routes.js` file there are all routes, which your app has. 

Also, in `imports/ui/pages` directory you can find all page components. Thanks to `akryum:vue-sass`, you can write SASS styles within you component. Is it great, isn't it? 

### ðŸ‘‰  What's inside? 

1. Meteor 1.7.5
2. Vue - 2.5.17
3. Vue Router - 3.0.1
4. VueX - 3.0.1

### ðŸ‘‰  Installation

1. Copy this repo.
2. Open terminal and navigate to the project.
3. Do:

```
$ meteor npm install
$ meteor npm start
```

I am looking forward to hear about **your** next project in Meteor and Vue!
